Login & Registration System with JavaScript
Overview:

This project is a basic login and registration system using Bootstrap for styling and JavaScript for functionality. It allows users to register by entering their full name, email, and password, storing the data in localStorage. Users can then log in by verifying their credentials against stored data. Alerts are used to notify users about successful registration, login, or errors.
